        "answer": [
          "There were two main reasons why I wanted to start Sultana. Having worked as a developer I felt like I had a lot of value to share. I’d always dreamt of starting something of my own and take great satisfaction in building something and watching it grow. Starting a business has been my life’s greatest challenge but also the most rewarding.",
          "The second reason is a general dissatisfaction with the services that were already on offer. Having looked at a number of codebases that were procured from other agencies I couldn’t help but feel ashamed that so many of my peers in the industry produce such low quality work for such a high price. I wanted to be a positive change in the industry and provide an avenue for people who are not tech savvy to comfortably take advantage of the technology out there and the benefits it can bring to your life."

          "Worked as an Apple repair technician however I felt like I’d hit a wall in terms of what I could learn and where I could take it in my career. My family all work in tech as developers so learning programming seemed like the logical step for me to take. I enrolled at Coder Academy’s coding bootcamp course and found that I have a natural flare for it and enjoyed the challenges it brings and the learning opportunities.",

I tend to handle most of the business side of things, making sure we’re operating effectively. I also personally do a lot of the development, handling a large part of the customer facing parts of our website. On top of my developer abilities I’m also a very creative person and enjoy all kinds of creative pursuits so see myself as a jack of all trades that fills in the gaps left by the rest of the team."

The world of technology is constantly changing and you have to be constantly learning new things to keep up. I’m always on the search for novel experiences and tech delivers that in droves. I’ve also always enjoyed solving problems and thinking logically."

          "Another thing that interests me is the ways we can now leverage data to guide our decisions. After reading the book “Freakonomics” I’ve been fascinated with what actually goes on in reality and how you can leverage data to get an accurate picture of what’s happening and how that can challenge our preconceived notions of what is true and what isn’t."

I’ve recently taken up skateboarding again, after gyms closed down due to covid. I needed an outlet and skateboarding proved to be fun and exciting, it keeps me  fit and in my youth."

My expertise is in project management, full stack development, and cloud infrastructure.  I know how it is planning and designing products and features, and following that through to developing products and applications."

          "Sometimes a few dedicated people working from a garage can make something that changes the world.  The outsized effect that software and technology can have on people and businesses has been truly flourishing since I started developing.  I also enjoy learning, and technology is one of those things that you never really stop learning.  Software is getting both easier to use, and also much more complicated, and I like to help people make more informed decisions when it comes to their website or application."

The way data is being used to drive the current innovation in machine learning has some amazing potential.  I think virtual and augmented reality will take a more common place in the near future, not for video games, but for educational purposes such as teaching people about car engines, or more complicated."
